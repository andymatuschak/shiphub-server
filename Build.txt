ASP.NET Core 1.0 is not in a good place.

Close Visual Studio.

To get started, install dnvm, dnx, and dnu. Why there are so many distinct, poorly named tools, I don't konw.

https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started/installing-on-windows.html

Now, since that's not enough, open up powershell.

$env:DNX_UNSTABLE_FEED="https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetcidev"
dnvm upgrade -u -ngen -a x86
dnvm upgrade -u -ngen -a x64

The build tooling should magically use the NuGet.config in this directory.

Eventually this will all change again.
